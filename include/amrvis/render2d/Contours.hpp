// sits at continuous coordinate (i + k / factor, j + l / factor) and every
// original sample lands exactly on a fine sample. physicalRegion is copied
// unchanged; sourceLevel holds the nearest original sample's level (left
// empty when the input plane has no per-sample levels).
//
// A fine sample takes the bilinear interpolation of the four surrounding
// original samples when all four are valid (valid != 0) and finite; otherwise
// it copies the value and validity of the nearest original sample. The
// nearest-sample fallback preserves plateaus and keeps NaN and invalid
// samples from bleeding across mask boundaries: a fine sample is valid if and
// only if its nearest original sample is valid and finite. Non-finite
// original samples count as invalid for this purpose and are never
// propagated; a fine sample that would copy a non-finite value is marked
// invalid and stores 0 instead.

// corner pair by the same formula in both adjacent cells, so endpoints match
// bit-exactly; chaining keys on the float bit patterns. A chain whose start
// and end coincide is reported as a closed loop (without a duplicated
// closing point). Polylines are returned grouped by contour value, in the
// order of `values`.
//
// Smoothing: each iteration replaces every segment (a, b) with the points at
// 1/4 and 3/4 along it (one iteration quarters corners; two looks genuinely
// smooth). Open polylines keep their first and last point fixed; closed
// loops cut every corner, wrapping around. Smoothed points are convex
// combinations of the chained points, so they stay inside the chained
// bounding box. This smoothing is a visual enhancement beyond legacy Amrvis
// behavior, which drew the raw segments. smoothIterations <= 0 returns the
// chained but unsmoothed polylines.
//
// Supersampling: with supersampleFactor > 1 the plane is first refined with
// supersamplePlane, segments are chained and smoothed on the fine grid, and
// every output coordinate is finally scaled back by 1 / supersampleFactor, so
// polylines are always returned in the original plane pixel space. This
// removes the cell-scale staircase that Chaikin smoothing alone cannot fix.
