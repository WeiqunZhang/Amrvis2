# Amrvis2

Amrvis2 is a C++20 and Qt 6 desktop application for interactive visualization
of AMReX data. One executable opens 2-D and 3-D plotfiles as well as standalone
FAB and MultiFab data.

## Highlights

- Demand-driven AMR reads with a bounded data cache
- IEEE-32 and IEEE-64 FAB input
- First-class raw MultiFab and FAB exploration, including per-dimension
  cell/nodal index types, ghost-cell-aware MultiFab views, multi-file FAB
  selection, and full stored-FAB inspection
- Composite and exact-level views, value probing, line plots, grid boxes,
  contours, and vector glyphs
- Three orthogonal slice views and an isometric overview for 3-D data
- Plotfile-sequence and plane-sweep animation
- Multiple palettes, logarithmic and user-defined ranges, and PNG/MP4 export
